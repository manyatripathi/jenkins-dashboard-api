Cases:
	If Jenkins and Database are well configured:
		1. Data is fetched from Jenkins
		2. Data is sent to mongoDB asynchronously
		3. Data is sent to UI(This happens as soon as data is fetched from Jenkins)
		
		When data insertion or updation is complete at mongoDB, then at console we will get number of rows inserted and updated.
	
	If Jenkins is not reachable, but Database is well configured: (To get this condition, change value in Jenkins env variables)
		Data is fetched from mongoDB, given database and collection are already present:
			a. Data is sent to UI
		
		Data is fetched from mongoDB, but database or collection or both are not present:
			a. Empty array is returned from mongoDB, thus below string is sent to UI 
				"No data is present at moment. Please check your configuration..."
